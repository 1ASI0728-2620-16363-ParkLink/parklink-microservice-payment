## C4 architecture

The diagram is a C4 **container view** focused on this repository and its relevant neighbors. It is generated from [Structurizr DSL](docs/architecture/workspace.dsl) using default styles, without custom colors. Arrows show the direction of an interaction; the full model also records message flows.

To inspect or regenerate the diagram, open `docs/architecture/workspace.dsl` in Structurizr. With the Structurizr CLI and Graphviz installed:

```sh
structurizr.sh validate -workspace docs/architecture/workspace.dsl
mkdir -p /tmp/parklink-diagram
structurizr.sh export -workspace docs/architecture/workspace.dsl -format dot -output /tmp/parklink-diagram
dot -Tsvg /tmp/parklink-diagram/structurizr-Containers.dot -o docs/architecture/containers.svg
```

## Build in the integrated workspace
